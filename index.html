          <p>The unrest in Syria, part of a wider wave of 2011 Arab Spring protests, grew out of discontent with the Assad government and escalated to an armed conflict after protests calling for his removal were violently suppressed.[105] The war is being fought by several factions: the Syrian government and its international allies, a loose alliance of Sunni Arab rebel groups (including the Free Syrian Army), the majority-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Salafi jihadist groups (including al-Nusra Front) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), with a number of countries in the region and beyond being either directly involved, or rendering support to one or another faction.

Iran, Russia and Hezbollah support the Syrian government militarily, with Russia conducting air operations in support of the government since September 2015. On the other hand, the U.S.-led international coalition established in 2014 with a declared purpose of countering ISIL, have conducted airstrikes against ISIL in Syria as well as against government and pro-government targets.

International organizations have accused the Syrian government, ISIL and rebel groups of severe human rights violations and of many massacres.[106] The conflict has caused a major refugee crisis. Over the course of the war a number of peace initiatives have been launched, including the March 2017 Geneva peace talks on Syria led by the United Nations, but fighting continues.[107]</p>

          <p>There is no respite for students appearing for the Central Board of Secondary Education's (CBSE) Class X and Class XII examinations. In the wake of news reports claiming that Mathematics and Economics papers were leaked on WhatsApp, the CBSE has decided to re-conduct the exams for Class X Mathematics and Class XII Economics paper. The new dates for the examinations and other details regarding the re-examination will be hosted on the CBSE website within a week.

In an official order, the CBSE said that it has taken cognisance "of certain happenings in the conduct of certain examinations". It further said that the dates for the fresh examinations and other details will be published on CBSE's website, cbse.nic.in. The reason for the decision was not revealed in the CBSE order. There was panic among students after the reports claiming paper leak surfaced on social media. The Delhi Police's Crime Branch has also begun investigating the alleged leak of the CBSE's Class XII economics paper and registered a separate case in connection with the alleged leak of the Class 10 mathematics paper. Top police officials, on Wednesday evening, also discussed the further line of investigation.</p>

          <p>What we saw though, the quick squash match that left pesky challenger John Cena laying in a tombstoned heap in less that 3 minutes, was assumedly all Undertaker was capable of. Just his greatest hits and then a victory lap-slash-dirge. The fact that the Cena vs. Undertaker match wasn't announced ahead of time sort of prepared us for this limited outing. Not giving us any real match expectations allowed this one to be more of a final "segment" than an actual bell-to-bell contest. I mean, it wasn't a segment, and there was a winner, but it was so one-sided that it may have well of just been a skit/intermission that saw Cena get his ass handed to him.

In fact, it started out as a skit. Elias trolled everyone by coming out first. To be honest, when I heard his guitar strum, I thought we might be getting the "Ain't No Grave" Johnny Cash Undertaker. Nope. Elias played us all for chumps and it was fantastic. So, all in all, this was a segment. It's just that Undertaker got to demolish John Cena in his final showing and leave with a 1-2-3 win.</p>

          <p>The Kathua rape case or Asifa rape case refers to the abduction, rape, and murder of an 8-year-old girl in Rasana village near Kathua in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir in January 2018. A chargesheet for the case has been filed, and the accused have been arrested and are expected to be tried in a court of law. The victim, Asifa Bano, belonged to the nomad Bakarwal community. She disappeared for a week before her dead body was discovered by the villagers a kilometer away from the village. The incident made national news when charges were filed against eight men in April 2018. The arrests of the accused led to protests from groups, one attended by two ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Forest Minister Chaudhary Lal Singh and Industries Minister Chander Prakash who have now resigned. The rape and murder, as well as the support the accused received, sparked widespread outrage.</p>

The winning bid was announced in Basseterre, Saint Kitts, on 11 November 2011. It is the fifth time Australia has hosted the Commonwealth Games.On 22 August 2008, the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, officially launched Gold Coast City's bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2018. On 7 April 2009, the ABC reported a land exchange deal between Gold Coast City and State of Queensland for Carrara Stadium. According to Mayor Ron Clarke, the land would aid a potential bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The land exchanged would be used as the site of an aquatics centre. In the same article, Mayor Clarke raised the question of the Australian Federal Government's commitment to a 2018 Commonwealth Games bid in light of the Government's support for Australia's 2018 FIFA World Cup Finals bid.</p>

          <p>Avengers: Infinity War is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is intended to be the sequel to 2012's Marvel's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In Avengers: Infinity War, the Avengers join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones.

The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War â€“ Part 1. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015 and by May, Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 "The Infinity Gauntlet" comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 "Infinity" comic. In July 2016, Marvel shortened the title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel. Additional filming took place in Scotland, England, the Downtown Atlanta area and New York City.</p>
